Revision history for Test-Aggregate

0.11
        - Added optional (and experimental) Perl::Tidy support.
        - Fixed broken 'verbose'.  The 'ok/not ok' message was being output
          regardless of verbose setting.

0.10   13/04/2008
        - Added startup, shutdown, setup, teardown attributes.
        - Add more tests.
        - Clean up dump file generated by tests.

0.08    09/04/2008
        - Require Test::Builder 0.74.
        - We now diag ok/not ok messages for each test program.  This makes it
          much easier to figure out which program failed.
        - Fixed warnings when 'dump' was not set.  Thanks to RENEEB for the
          bug report [http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32443]

0.07    05/03/2008
        - Added TEST_AGGREGATE environment variable.

0.06    15/01/2007
        - Use an END block instead of adding Test::Builder::DESTROY.  This is
          cleaner and doesn't override the DESTROY provided by Test::Most.

0.05    29/12/2007
        - Fixed an open in aggtests/boilerplate.t which made the module fail
          with 5.005.

0.04    29/12/2007
        - Fixed open() to work with versions of Perl < 5.6
        - More extensive overriding of Test::Builder internals.  I tried to
          subclass it but it's not designed to be subclassed and much pain
          ensued.
        - Dump file now has all "run_the_tests" lines at the top and the
          packages below them.  This makes for easier debugging as you can
          comment out test packages one by one simply by commenting out its
          "run_the_tests" line.
        - Fixed bug where runtests() would run tests in a different order from
          the dump file.
        - Fixed bug where Test::NoWarnings would try to run a test after the
          plan was output.

0.03    29/11/2007
        - Moved 'skip_all' files into the t/ directory. Aggregating them
          fails.  mauzo (http://use.perl.org/~mauzo/)

0.02    26/11/2007
        - Fixed bug where multiple tests setting an explicit plan in the use
          statement would cause failures.
        - Attempt to work around 'unauthorized release' issue on the CPAN.
          Simply declaring the 'Test::Builder' package directly is frowned
          upon.
        - Update the docs to warn explain 'shared variable' warnings.

0.01    25/11/2007
        First version.  Run test suites faster.
